## Summary <br/>
*Here is the Bootcamp project we made with Angular Pairy 4 Bootcamp ! From the beginning to the end of this project, we are together with our teammates at the CASGEM center, where we receive training every day. We have been working on this project for hours every day for 30 days. Let me tell you a little about what we did in the project;
First, we have a guest screen. On this screen, you can get to know us, see the bootcamps and register and log in to your relevant screens. If you enter a candidate, you will be greeted by a different screen where the bootcamps are listed. If you log in as an employee (admin), a management screen will welcome you. From this screen, you can do everything on behalf of the administration. If you are an instructor, you will see a screen where you can see the candidates and blacklist them,list the trainings you will give and intervene.*
